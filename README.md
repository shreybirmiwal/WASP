# WASP â€“ AI-Powered UX Testing

## The Problem

UX testing is critical for startups aiming to deliver exceptional user experiences. However, traditional UX testing methods are usually expensive, time-consuming, and often inaccurate or inconsistent. These barriers make it difficult for small teams to iterate quickly and validate their product decisions.

## ðŸ¤– What is WASP?

**WASP** is an AI-driven tool that revolutionizes UX testing by simulating thousands of users. By leveraging browser agents, WASP can simulate human interaction with your website, complete specified tasks, and provide real-time insights on usability and flow.
